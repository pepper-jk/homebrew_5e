## Dreamwalker (Askan)
**Lucid Dreamer.** *[RP]* You can benefit from a long rest during the dream spell. As long as you do not inflict any damage with the spell, you can cast it even if you do not have any spell slots left.

**Rising Nightmare.** *[combat]* You trigger your foes mind to conjure their last nightmare. As a bonus action, choose three creatures within range (60 feet). They must succeed a Intelligence saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute as they experience a nightmarish vision. As long as they are frightened, every time they get hit by an attack, they take additional 1d4 psychic damage.

This has no effect on constructs. The DC for the save is your spell save DC. You can use this feature once per long rest.

**Pick on somebody your own size.** *[combat]* Dishonorable behavior in battle disgusts you. Once per short rest, if an ally gets hit by a melee weapon attack from a creature with a higher Strength score then them, you can use your reaction to move up to your speed toward the attacking creature.
If you end your movement in range of your reach to it, you can use one of the following effects:
- Make a melee attack against it. During the attack you can use a free maneuver using a d8 as the superiority die.
- You place yourself in front of your ally. Until the end of your allies next turn any creature has disadvantage on attack rolls against them, but advantage against you.

**Natural Healing.** *[combat]* You know about the natural flow of magic a forest uses to heal itself and can channel this energy to heal your companions. While in forest terrain, as a reaction to any ally dropping to 0 hit points you can cast *mass cure wounds* at base level. Once you have used this feature, you can not use it again until you finish a long rest.

**Deer Path.** *[intrigue]* Your Operation tests done in forest terrain have advantage.

**Survivors.** *[warfare]* Choose a number of units with Light Equipment equal to your command rating. While in forest terrain these units gain advantage on either Power and Moral tests, you choose.

## Shadow Dancer (Aseir)
**Fleeting Feet.** *[RP]* As long as your companions are within 15 ft. of you, they benefit from your Stealth check, while "traveling".

**Shadow Dance.** *[combat]* If you would normally reveal your position as you attack, you can make a Dexterity (Stealth) check with disadvantage to stay hidden instead.

**Shadow Mission.** *[intrigue]* Make an Espionage check against the enemy's Resolve. If successful their Combat Readiness goes down 2 steps.
