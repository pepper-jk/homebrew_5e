# Chronicle of Finellah
(Fionnghuala)

## Foreword

Fionnghuala (Finellah) is a fey demi-deity worshiped by rangers.
This book contains her research on archfey and their customs.
Specifically she focuses on the conflict between the Seelie and Unseelie Court.
As a veteran of the last big conflict between Titania and her sister the Queen of Air and Darkness,
she is looking to resolve the situation.
And she might finally have found a way to defeat the utterly corrupted evil queen of Pandemonium.

From time to time the book might slip into a journal type of writing,
after all it is Finellah's diary.

### Black Diamond Facet
*Gem (Black Diamond), major tier, artifact (requires attunement)*
___
The Black Diamond is an ancient artifact.
Its true origin is unknown, but in prehistoric times it was uncovered by dwarves under a mountain.
They presented it to the Seelie Court as a gift in good faith.
Titania's sister, the Queen of Air and Darkness, was utterly corrupted by it,
which ultimately lead to the destruction of the original sylvan realm.

It is not known when or why exactly the diamond was split into its facets.
Maybe the queen split them in an attempt to hide the source of her power from her enemies.
Or she tried to reinforce their avatars and cover more ground for her evil plan to enslave all of the sylvan races.
Maybe it got shattered during a conflict with Titania and other members of the Seelie Court.
However it happened though, now the facets spread corruption throughout the planes.

A black diamond facet alone already holds a lot of power,
when two or more come together their evil magic is said to multiply.
All ten of them combined could be enough to destroy an entire plane or at least make it uninhabitable.

- While within one mile of the Facet, the attuned creature gains the following benefits:
  - **Magic Resistance**
    You gain **magic resistance**.
  - **Mindless Thralls.**
    You can control undead, hell hounds and yeth hounds at will.
    You know the location of any undead within one mile of the facet and can call them for help.
    If you do so, they arrive within 1d6 rounds.
  - **Spells.**
    You may cast each of the following spells once per day:
    *Circle of Death*, *Create Food and Water*, *Finger of Death*, and *Summon Shadowspawn*,
    which is always cast at 5th level and summons one **shadow spirit** for every three of your spell casting level.

    The food created by this item is tainted with a terrible, sweet, addictive substance.
    If a creature consumes the food, it must succeed a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become addicted.
    The DC increases by 1 for any subsequent consume.
    On a success the creature is immune for 1d4 hours.
    On a failure it is now *dominated* (as per *Dominate Person*) by you.
    It is desperate to receive more of your nourishment, risking anything and everything to obtain it.
- **Combining Facets.**
  If two facets are brought together within 30 feet they fly towards each other and snap together.
  A successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check can keep them apart.
  Once they are combined they seem inseparable.
  However, a successful DC 25 Strength (Athletics) check or 27 thunder or magical slashing damage can split them.

  When combined the facets grant the following benefits:
  - For each additional facet, you can cast the spells listed above once more per day
    and the radius of the facets effects increases by one mile.
  - You only need to attune to one facet.
  - If three facets are combined you can cast *Power Word Kill* or *Psychic Scream* once per day.
    With five or more facets you can cast one of them three times per day.
  - If ten facets are combined ...
    - As a reaction to killing a creature, you can immediately bring them back as an undead servant loyal to you.
      It regains 100 hit points and goes on the next initiative count.
      Its creature type is undead otherwise it maintains all its features and equipment.
- **Corruption.**
  Whenever a creature attunes to the Black Diamond Facet, that creature must make a DC 20 Charisma shaving throw.
  On a failed save, the creature's alignment changes to chaotic evil.
- **Destroying a Facet.**
  A Black Diamond Facet appears fragile but is impervious to most damage.
  However, it might be destroyed by the following spells:
  *Bigby's Hand* casted at 9th level,
  *Disintegrate*,
  *Dispel Evil and Good*,
  *Shatter* casted at 5th level or higher,
  or *Transmute Rock*.

  The legendary wizard Mordenkainen is able to disjunct a facet (see 2nd edition for *Mordekainen's disjunction*).
  At the DMs discretion Titania or **a powerful magical artifact** might also be able to destroy a facet.

  If a facet is destroyed, an avatar of the queen of air and darkness might materialize and seek revenge.


### Chronicle of Fionnghuala [fin-ell-ah]
*Book, artifact*
___
Reading in this book for one hour grants *at least one piece of lore* about Titania, the Summer Queen, and her sister the Queen of Air and Darkness, the conflict between them, an item or a location significant to the conflict.
The reader makes an Intelligence (Arcana, History, or Investigation) check to determine how much lore they learn during one hour of reading.
If they pass a DC 10, they learn one additional piece of lore to a total of two.
If they pass a DC 20, they learn two additional pieces of lore to a total of three.

> FIXME: on a failed save the character does not learn anything?
> meh for players, but good for evil creatures

At the end of the hour the reader must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw.
On a success, the creature becomes immune to the books effect for 24 hours.
On a failure, the creature takes 4d6 psychic damage and is afflicted by a **short-term madness**.
The creature must repeat the saving throw for every hour spent reading until it succeeds.
If a creature fails the save three times, it is afflicted by a **long-term madness**.

Creatures with **Fey Ancestry** have advantage on the saving throw.
Evil aligned or undead creatures have disadvantage.
Fey and swanmways carrying a simulacra feather automatically succeed.

If a creature reads in the book for 24 hours over the cause of 6 days, it must repeat the saving throw again.
Even if it was immune for the next 24 hours.
On a failure, it is afflicted by an **indefinite madness**.
On a success, the creature becomes immune to the books effect indefinitely.

| Check Total   | Pieces of Lore    |
|---------------|-------------------|
| 1-10          | 1
| 11-20         | 2
| 21+           | 3

**Destroying the Book.**
The book, along with anything written on its pages, is immune to non-magical damage.
It can only be destroyed by the following spells:
*Disintegrate*,
*Dispel Evil and Good*,
*Fireball*;
or by 50 magical slashing damage.
In addition, the book doesn't deteriorate with age.

If the book is destroyed, roll a d6 on the Seelie Court row of the Servitors chart.
Whatever creature is summoned will attempt to strike down the creature(s) who caused the destruction of the book.
Additionally, any swanmays within 5 miles are alerted to the destruction as well and will appear at the location of the destruction within a number of rounds depending on the distance.
Per mile it takes them 1d6 rounds.

#### Lore
This book holds knowledge about the conflict between Titania, the Summer Queen, and her sister the Queen of Air and Darkness.
It was written by the demi-goddess Fionnghuala and was distributed to her most faithful followers.
It is unknown how many copies exist in the mundane world.
As long as they are at most one plane of existence apart from the original,
a copy updated when Fionnghuala writes into the original.
However, she always keeps the original,
which usually means either in the feywild or the material plane.
If a copy is ever more than one plane of existence away from the original,
it will receive the updates once it is at most one plane apart again.

#### Notes
Fionnghuala's [fin-ell-ah] last entry states that she is making a journey to
- locate the black diamond facets
- find the origin of the black diamonds
This was about a century ago
Since then she vanished from the material plane.


### Gem of Brilliance
*Wondrous item (Diamond), major tier, very rare (requires attunement)*
___
This prismatic diamond emits dim bluish light in a 30-foot radius when at least one undead is within that area. Any undead that starts its turn in that area takes 1d6 radiant damage.

This prism has 50 charges. It regains 1d10 + 5 expended charges daily at dawn. While you are holding it, you can use an action to speak one of four command words to cause one of the following effects:

- The first command word causes the gem to shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. This effect doesn't expend a charge. It lasts until you use a bonus action to repeat the command word or until you use another function of the gem.
- The second command word expends 1 charge and causes the gem to fire a brilliant beam of light at one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become blinded for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
- The third command word expends 5 charges and causes the gem to flare with blinding light in a 30-foot cone originating from it. Each creature in the cone must make a saving throw as if struck by the beam created with the second command word.
- The fourth command word expends 15 charges and causes the gem to cast *prismatic spray* (save DC 18).

When all of the gem's charges are expended, the gem becomes a nonmagical jewel worth 50 gp.


### Instrument of the Seelie Court
*Instrument, rare*
___
When you play the instrument, you can roll a d6 on the Seelie Court row of the Servitors chart.
Whatever creature is summoned will aid the creatures who holds the flute.
Additionally, any fey within 1 mile is alerted to the call for aid as well and will appear within 1d6 rounds.
They fey will only interfere if their CR is at least half of the highest CR opponent.
Once this effect is used, the flute can not be used until you take an extended rest at your Stronghold or a Stronghold linked to the Seelie Court.
> TODO: fix make it bless or other buffs? (as Anne hates summons)

  - The wand acts as a +2 rod of the pact keeper.

    It regains 2d6 + 2 expended charges daily at dawn.

  However, if doing so brings the wand's total number of charges above its maximum, the wand explodes as if you activated its retributive strike (see below).

> **Conjure Fey Variant:**
> If you cast conjure fey you can instead summon a d6 fey unit.
> For every two additional charges you expend the size of the unit increases by one.

- **Retributive Strike.**
  You can use an action to break the staff over your knee or against a solid surface, performing a retributive strike. The staff is destroyed and releases its remaining magic in an explosion that expands to fill a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on it.
  You have a 50 percent chance to instantly travel to a random plane of existence, avoiding the explosion. If you fail to avoid the effect, you take force damage equal to 16 × the number of charges in the staff. Every other creature in the area must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes an amount of damage based on how far away it is from the point of origin, as shown in the following table. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage.
