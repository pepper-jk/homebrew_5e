# Nelly's extraordinary Mounts

## Mounts

The following mounts are designed to be used by the mounted combat rules introduces in the article "Jumping on Mounted Combat" by Willy Abeel in the first issue of [Arcadia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oid4QMMXjfs) produced by MCDM.

For now I focused on some basic mounts. However, I plan to work on some more mounts in the future, wyvern mounts, fey (touched) mounts and more beast based mounts for my druid player to turn into.

### Common Mounts

If adventurers travel long distances they usually rely on mounts to cover more ground per day.
The most common mount would be the **riding horse**.
However, some folk may require smaller mounts, like **ponies** or **mastiffs**, to get around.
Spellcasters may cast *find steed* to get their first mount.
This section covers the most common mounts an adventuring party may start out with.

> **Find Steed Variant**
>
> The spirit summoned by the find steed spell can take the form of a **mount** over the standard beast, allowing the caster to utilize the new features of the following creatures. This includes the camel, elk, mastiff, pony and warhorse mounts.

#### Camel Mount
- based on **camel** stats
- **Temporary Hit Points** 4 times the rider’s character level or challenge rating
- **Mounted.** For this trait see [Arcadia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oid4QMMXjfs).
##### Actions
- **Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack: +3 + PB to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (2d4 + 3) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, the camel tries to grab onto the targets equipment and the target must succeed on a DC 9 + PB Dexterity saving throw or suffer a -2 penalty to AC until it uses have its movement action to fix his armor.
- **Stampede (3/Day).** If the camel moves 15 ft. towards an enemy and at least one other camel joins it, they overrun enemies in their path. While they move together they gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks when it moves out of an enemy’s reach, and can move through spaces occupied by other creatures. Each creature in the herds way must make a DC 11 + PB Strength saving throw or take 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage, plus 5 (1d8) for each additional camel above two, and be knocked prone. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn’t knocked prone.
##### Reactions
- **Join the Herd.** If another Camel starts the **Stampede** action, a rider may use their reaction to join the other camel. First the camel needs to move up to the other camel and can move with the herd as far as its movement allows. Any movement used in this reaction is subtracted from the movement for the camels next turn.

#### Elk Mount
- based on **elk** stats
- **Temporary Hit Points** 4 times the rider’s character level or challenge rating
- **Charge.** If the elk moves at least 15 feet straight toward a target it starts charging.
- **Mounted.** For this trait see [Arcadia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oid4QMMXjfs).
##### Actions
- **Combat Ram.** Melee Weapon Attack: +3 + PB to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage, or 13 (3d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage if the elk is charging on the same turn. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 11 + PB Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.
- **Wild Charge (3/Day).** The elk gains resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks when it moves out of an enemy’s reach, and can move through spaces occupied by other creatures until the end of its turn. Each creature in the elk’s way must make a DC 11 + PB Strength saving throw or take 13 (3d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn’t knocked prone.
##### Reactions
- **Antler Parry.** If either the elk or its rider would be hit by a melee attack, the rider may use their reaction to command the elk to use his antlers to fend off the foe. The elk may either oppose disadvantage against the melee attack or add 2 to its AC and the AC of its rider against all melee attacks from the foe.

#### Mastiff Mount
- based on **mastiff** stats
- **Temporary Hit Points** 4 times the rider’s character level or challenge rating
- **Mounted.** For this trait see [Arcadia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oid4QMMXjfs).
##### Actions
- **Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack: +1 + PB to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (2d4 + 1) piercing damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 9 + PB Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.
- **Bite down.** Melee Weapon Attack: +1 + PB to hit, reach 5 ft., one Medium or smaller creature. Hit: 9 (2d4 + 1) piercing damage. The target is grappled (escape DC 9 + PB). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained and the Mastiff can use its action to deal 9 (2d4 + 1) piercing damage. The mastiff can grapple only one target at a time.
- **Sniff.** The mastiff sniffs out targets it can not see. It makes a Wisdom (Perception) check with advantage due to its *Keen Hearing and Smell*. If the target is within 30ft. of the mastiff during the mastiffs turn, the target does not benefit from being hidden or invisible against the mastiff and its rider until the start of its next turn.

#### Pony Mount
- based on **pony** stats

- **Rear Up (1/Day).** Using half its movement the pony rears up, whirling its hooves and inflicting disadvantage on any melee attack rolls within 5ft. of it until the beginning of its next turn. If the pony uses its opportunity attack of the **Step Out** reaction, this effect ends.
##### Reaction
- **Step Out.** If the pony is approached by an opponent from the rear, meaning a creature enters a space behind it, the rider may use their reaction and let the pony perform a **Combat Stomp** as an attack of opportunity.

##### Reaction
- **Step Out.** If the horse is approached by an opponent from the rear, meaning a creature enters a space behind it, the rider may use their reaction and let the horse perform a **Combat Stomp** as an attack of opportunity.

## Creating a Mount

As a lot of people have wondered how to design an Arcadia mount, I decided to write up a quick guide for it.
I reverse engineered the following rules from the examples provided in Arcadia.
So if you find any mathematical errors or other faults with it let me know and I will fix it.
I tried to stay as close to the vision presented in Arcadia as possible.
However, here and there I needed to improvise, extrapolate and assume.
If official mounts released in the future disproof this guide, I will update it.

> Of cause these rules are only guidelines, so if you have different ideas for your mount, do as you wish.

First you decide on a monster you want your mount to be to base on.
For this take a look at the [SRD](https://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/systems-reference-document-srd), as it is open game content and holds a lot of options from the Monster Manual already.
Once you got your non-mount stat block, we add the **Mounted** trait and apply it.

> **Mounted.** For this trait see [Arcadia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oid4QMMXjfs).

To determine the **temporary hit points** for it take a look at the hit points of the monster and use the temporary hit points table.
The **armor class** becomes `10 + Dexterity + natural armor (if any) + PB`.
Proficient **saving throws** and **skills** are now `ability modifier + PB`.
The rest of the core stat block remains untouched.
Hit points, speed, abilities, senses, languages and challenge rating stay the same.
Now lets look at the traits and actions of the monster.

Any trait associated with combat, e.g. dealing additional damage, usually gets split into a utility and combat part.
**Utility** stays as a trait and **damage** and **saving throws** are moved to the base attack.
Any sense or ability based traits stay.
The **base attack action** gets buffed as follows.
The attack does more damage and gets an **extra effect** that triggers after a failed saving throw by the target.
Note that any **saving throw DCs** are based on the mounts ability modifier that belongs to it, specifically `8 + ability modifier + PB`.

Now comes the creative part.
The monster gets **two more actions** in addition to its now buffed base attack.
Any combination of the following:
- an action that can be used three times a day (3/Day)
- an action that can be used once a day (1/Day)
- a reaction

Each action should represent a feature of the creature.
It should fit and feel real.
In the best case these features are unique to the mount.

| HP    | temporary HP  |
|-------|---------------|
| 1-9   | 5 times the rider’s character level or challenge rating
| 10-44 | 4 times the rider’s character level or challenge rating
| 45-64 | 3 times the rider’s character level or challenge rating
| 65-84 | 2 times the rider’s character level or challenge rating
| 85-99 | 1 time the rider’s character level or challenge rating
| 100+  | 0 times the rider’s character level or challenge rating

## Licensing
The mounts and the spell variants are to be considered [open game content](OGL.md). Any flavor text (that might be added later) is considered [CC-BY-SA-4.0](LICENSE.md). Feel free to credit me even if you only use OGL content though, it would be much appreciated.
