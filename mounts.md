# Nelly's extraordinary Mounts

## Taking care of a Mount

A mount is not just a tool for travel, it is a living being.
It has needs, feelings and desires.
If mistreated or neglected a mount may abandon you, when it gets the chance.
Although you might find taking care of a mount to be a time consuming annoyance, it can be also rewarding to form a bond with your mount.
In this section I talk about the basic needs of mounts.
The food and accommodation they need and prefer.
And how you may improve the bond between a mount and their rider.

### Types of Mounts

While studying mounts I found that one can categorize them into four groups.
Each type brings some characteristics that distinguishes it from the others.

**Common mounts** are mostly common mounts, like horses and mastiffs, but also pegasi and unicorns. Such mounts don't need special care besides the usual feed and stabling.

Bears, wolfs, giant spiders and other carnivorous are considered **dangerous mounts**, as are griffons, hippogriffs, other monstrosities and everything larger than *Huge*.

**Exotic mounts** are rare and seldomly seen on the streets, but they are heard of.
Necromancer riding undead horses, Articifers or Gnomes riding construction of cogs and screws, Goblins riding Ogres or Knights riding dragons.

The most rare mounts are creatures summoned from different planes of existence. These **extra-planar mounts** need special care and typically scare most common folk. However, there are exceptions to the rule, like the unicorn and the pegasus.

| Mount Type    | Monster Type  |
|---------------|---------------|
| common        | Beast (Large or smaller, herbivorous), Celestial (Pegasus, Unicorn)
| dangerous     | Beast (Huge or larger, carnivorous), Monstrosity
| exotic        | Construct, Dragon, Giant, Ooze, Plant, Undead
| extra-planar  | Aberration, Celestial, Elemental, Fey, Fiend

### Maintenance of a Mount

While finding accommodation for the most mounted beast may be trivial, an Innkeeper may refuse to offer your mount stabling, if they deem it too dangerous.
Most taverns on the material plane would not want your **Hellhound Mount** in their stable.
Afraid it might burn the stable down or eat the other steeds.
Some might even have problems with a **Bear Mount** or a **Tiger Mount**.
However, a simple Charisma (Persuasion) check might do the trick in addition to increased payment of cause.

Charisma (Persuasion) DC of Innkeepers regarding housing a mount.
| DC    | Type          |
|-------|---------------|
| 15    | dangerous
| 17    | exotic
| 20    | extra-planar

A common mount has the cost of 5 cp for feed and 5 sp for stabling per day.

| Type          | Feed      | Stabling  | Prerequisite |
|---------------|-----------|-----------|--------------|
| common        |  5 cp     |  5 sp     |
| dangerous     |  1 sp     |  1 gp     |
| exotic        |  2 sp     |  2 gp     |
| extra-planar  |  1 gp     |  5 gp     |

### Care of an Exotic or Extra-Planar Mount

A special mount requires special treatment.
A wolf may need to hunt from time to time.
A hell hound may need to bath in fire from time to time.
A fey mount may need to visit (silvan) woods to restore its energy.

## Mounts

The following mounts are designed to be used by the mounted combat rules introduces in the article "Jumping on Mounted Combat" by Willy Abeel in the first issue of [Arcadia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oid4QMMXjfs) produced by MCDM.

For now I focused on some basic mounts. However, I plan to work on some more mounts in the future, wyvern mounts, fey (touched) mounts and more beast based mounts for my druid player to turn into.

### Common Mounts

If adventurers travel long distances they usually rely on mounts to cover more ground per day.
The most common mount would be the **riding horse**.
However, some folk may require smaller mounts, like **ponies** or **mastiffs**, to get around.
Spellcasters may cast *find steed* to get their first mount.
This section covers the most common mounts an adventuring party may start out with.

> **Find Steed Variant**
>
> The spirit summoned by the find steed spell can take the form of a **mount** over the standard beast, allowing the caster to utilize the new features of the following creatures. This includes the camel, elk, mastiff, pony and warhorse mounts.

Each creature in the herds way must make a DC 11 + PB Strength saving throw or take 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage, plus 5 (1d8) for each additional camel above two, and be knocked prone.

## Creating a Mount

As a lot of people have wondered how to design an Arcadia mount, I decided to write up a quick guide for it.
I reverse engineered the following rules from the examples provided in Arcadia.
So if you find any mathematical errors or other faults with it let me know and I will fix it.
I tried to stay as close to the vision presented in Arcadia as possible.
However, here and there I needed to improvise, extrapolate and assume.
If official mounts released in the future disproof this guide, I will update it.

> Of cause these rules are only guidelines, so if you have different ideas for your mount, do as you wish.

First you decide on a monster you want your mount to be to base on.
For this take a look at the [SRD](https://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/systems-reference-document-srd), as it is open game content and holds a lot of options from the Monster Manual already.
Once you got your non-mount stat block, we add the **Mounted** trait and apply it.

> **Mounted.** For this trait see [Arcadia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oid4QMMXjfs).

To determine the **temporary hit points** for it take a look at the hit points of the monster and use the temporary hit points table.
The **armor class** becomes `10 + Dexterity + natural armor (if any) + PB`.
Proficient **saving throws** and **skills** are now `ability modifier + PB`.
The rest of the core stat block remains untouched.
Hit points, speed, abilities, senses, languages and challenge rating stay the same.
Now lets look at the traits and actions of the monster.

Any trait associated with combat, e.g. dealing additional damage, usually gets split into a utility and combat part.
**Utility** stays as a trait and **damage** and **saving throws** are moved to the base attack.
Any sense or ability based traits stay.
The **base attack action** gets buffed as follows.
The attack does more damage and gets an **extra effect** that triggers after a failed saving throw by the target.
Note that any **saving throw DCs** are based on the mounts ability modifier that belongs to it, specifically `8 + ability modifier + PB`.

Now comes the creative part.
The monster gets **two more actions** in addition to its now buffed base attack.
Any combination of the following:
- an action that can be used three times a day (3/Day)
- an action that can be used once a day (1/Day)
- a reaction

Each action should represent a feature of the creature.
It should fit and feel real.
In the best case these features are unique to the mount.

> Variant Rule: rest based actions
> either 3/day = short rest, 1/day = long rest
> or 3/day = 1 slot on a short rest and all 3 on a long rest
> and 1/day = 1 slot on a long rest
