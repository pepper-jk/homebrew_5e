# mounts

The following mounts are designed to be used by the mounted combat rules introduces in the article "Jumping on Mounted Combat" by Willy Abeel in the first issue of [Arcadia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oid4QMMXjfs) produced by MCDM.

These mounts and the spell variants are to be considered [open game content](OGL.md). Any flavor text (that might be added later) is considered [CC-BY-SA-4.0](LICENSE.md). Feel free to credit me even if you only use OGL content though, it would be much appreciated.

For now I focused on the **riding horse mount**, as my players will get some soon, and the mounts included in ***find steed*** besides the warhorse, which was already covered by the article itself. However, I plan to work on some more mounts in the future, wyvern mounts, fey (touched) mounts and more beast based mounts for my druid player to turn into.

> **Find Steed Variant**
>
> The spirit summoned by the find steed spell can take the form of a **mount** over the standard beast, allowing the caster to utilize the new features of the following creatures. This includes the camel, elk, mastiff, pony and warhorse mounts.

## Camel Mount
- based on **camel** stats
- **Temporary Hit Points** 4 times the rider’s character level or challenge rating
- **Mounted.** During a long rest, the camel can designate one creature that rode it within the last 10 days as its rider. The camel gains a number of temporary hit points based on the rider’s level or challenge rating after completing the long rest. The camel uses its rider’s proficiency bonus in place of its own proficiency bonus for AC, ability checks, attack rolls, saving throws, and the DC made to save against certain action effects.
### Actions
- **Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack: +3 + PB to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (2d4 + 3) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, the camel tries to grab onto the targets equipment and the target must succeed on a DC 9 + PB Dexterity saving throw or suffer a -2 penalty to AC until it uses have its movement action to fix his armor.
- **Herd Trample (3/Day).** If the camel moves 15 ft. towards an enemy and at least one other camel joins it, they overrun enemies in their path. While they move together they gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks when it moves out of an enemy’s reach, and can move through spaces occupied by other creatures. Each creature in the herds way must make a DC 11 + PB Strength saving throw or take 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage, plus 5 (1d8) for each additional camel above two, and be knocked prone. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn’t knocked prone.
### Reactions
- **Join the Herd.** If another Camel starts the **Herd Trample** action, a rider may use their reaction to join the herd. First the camel needs to move up to the other camel and can move with the herd as far as its movement allows. Any movement used in this reaction is subtracted from the movement for the camels next turn.

## Elk Mount
- based on **elk** stats

On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn’t knocked prone.
### Reactions
- **Antler Parry.** If either the elk or its rider would be hit by a melee attack, the rider may use their reaction to command the elk to use his antlers to fend off the foe. The elk may either oppose disadvantage against the melee attack or add 2 to its AC and the AC of its rider against all melee attacks from the foe.

## Mastiff Mount
- based on **mastiff** stats

Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained and the Mastiff can use its action to deal 9 (2d4 + 1) piercing damage. The mastiff can grapple only one target at a time.
- **Sniff.** The mastiff sniffs out targets it can not see. It makes a Wisdom (Perception) check with advantage due to its *Keen Hearing and Smell*. If the target is within 30ft. of the mastiff during the mastiffs turn, the target does not benefit from being hidden or invisible against the mastiff and its rider until the start of its next turn.
