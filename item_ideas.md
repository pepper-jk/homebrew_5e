## The Chronicle of Fionnghuala [fin-ell-ah]
*Book, artifact*
___
Reading in this book for one hour grants *at least one piece of lore* about Titania, the Summer Queen, and her sister the Queen of Air and Darkness, the conflict between them, an item or a location significant to the conflict.
The reader makes an Intelligence (Arcana, History, or Investigation) check to determine how much lore they learn during one hour of reading.
If they pass a DC 10, they learn one additional piece of lore to a total of two.
If they pass a DC 20, they learn two additional pieces of lore to a total of three.

> FIXME: on a failed save the character does not learn anything?
> meh for players, but good for evil creatures

At the end of the hour the reader must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw.
On a success, the creature becomes immune to the books effect for 24 hours.
On a failure, the creature takes 4d6 psychic damage and is afflicted by a **short-term madness**.
The creature must repeat the saving throw for every hour spent reading until it succeeds.
If a creature fails the save three times, it is afflicted by a **long-term madness**.

Creatures with **Fey Ancestry** have advantage on the saving throw.
Evil aligned or undead creatures have disadvantage.
Fey and swanmways carrying a simulacra feather automatically succeed.

If a creature reads in the book for 24 hours over the cause of 6 days, it must repeat the saving throw again.
Even if it was immune for the next 24 hours.
On a failure, it is afflicted by an **indefinite madness**.
On a success, the creature becomes immune to the books effect indefinitely.

| Check Total   | Pieces of Lore    |
|---------------|-------------------|
| 1-10          | 1
| 11-20         | 2
| 21+           | 3

**Destroying the Book.**
The book, along with anything written on its pages, is immune to non-magical damage.
It can only be destroyed by the following spells:
*Disintegrate*,
*Dispel Evil and Good*,
*Fireball*;
or by 50 magical slashing damage.
In addition, the book doesn't deteriorate with age.

If the book is destroyed, roll a d6 on the Seelie Court row of the Servitors chart.
Whatever creature is summoned will attempt to strike down the creature(s) who caused the destruction of the book.
Additionally, any swanmays within 5 miles are alerted to the destruction as well and will appear at the location of the destruction within a number of rounds depending on the distance.
Per mile it takes them 1d6 rounds.

### Lore
This book holds knowledge about the conflict between Titania, the Summer Queen, and her sister the Queen of Air and Darkness.
It was written by the demi-goddess Fionnghuala and was distributed to her most faithful followers.
It is unknown how many copies exist in the mundane world.
As long as they are at most one plane of existence apart from the original,
a copy updated when Fionnghuala writes into the original.
However, she always keeps the original,
which usually means either in the feywild or the material plane.
If a copy is ever more than one plane of existence away from the original,
it will receive the updates once it is at most one plane apart again.

### Notes
Fionnghuala's [fin-ell-ah] last entry states that she is making a journey to
- locate the black diamond facets
- find the origin of the black diamonds
This was about a century ago
Since then she vanished from the material plane.


## Black Diamond Facet
*Gem (Black Diamond), major tier, artifact (requires attunement)*
___
- While within one mile of the Facet, the attuned creature gains the following benefits:
  - **Magic Resistance**
    You gain **magic resistance**.
  - **Mindless Thralls.**
    You can control undead, hell hounds and yeth hounds at will.
    You know the location of any undead within one mile of the facet and can call them for help.
    If you do so, they arrive within 1d6 rounds.
  - **Spells.**
    You may cast each of the following spells once per day:
    *Circle of Death*, *Create Food and Water*, *Finger of Death*, and *Summon Shadowspawn*,
    which is always cast at 5th level and summons one **shadow spirit** for every three of your spell casting level.

    The food created by this item is tainted with a terrible, sweet, addictive substance.
    If a creature consumes the food, it must succeed a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become addicted.
    The DC increases by 1 for any subsequent consume.
    On a success the creature is immune for 1d4 hours.
    On a failure it is now *dominated* (as per *Dominate Person*) by you.
    It is desperate to receive more of your nourishment, risking anything and everything to obtain it.
- **Combining Facets.**
  If two facets are brought together within 30 feet they fly towards each other and snap together.
  A successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check can keep them apart.
  Once they are combined they seem inseparable.
  However, a successful DC 25 Strength (Athletics) check or 27 thunder or magical slashing damage can split them.

  When combined the facets grant the following benefits:
  - For each additional facet, you can cast the spells listed above once more per day
    and the radius of the facets effects increases by one mile.
  - You only need to attune to one facet.
  - If three facets are combined you can cast *Power Word Kill* or *Psychic Scream* once per day.
    With five or more facets you can cast one of them three times per day.
  - If ten facets are combined ...
    - As a reaction to killing a creature, you can immediately bring them back as an undead servant loyal to you.
      It regains 100 hit points and goes on the next initiative count.
      Its creature type is undead otherwise it maintains all its features and equipment.
- **Corruption.**
  Whenever a creature attunes to the Black Diamond Facet, that creature must make a DC 20 Charisma shaving throw.
  On a failed save, the creature's alignment changes to chaotic evil.
- **Destroying a Facet.**
  A Black Diamond Facet appears fragile but is impervious to most damage.
  However, it might be destroyed by the following spells:
  *Bigby's Hand* casted at 9th level,
  *Disintegrate*,
  *Dispel Evil and Good*,
  *Shatter* casted at 5th level or higher,
  or *Transmute Rock*.

  The legendary wizard Mordenkainen is able to disjunct a facet (see 2nd edition for *Mordekainen's disjunction*).
  At the DMs discretion Titania might also be able to destroy a facet.

  If a facet is destroyed, an avatar of the queen of air and darkness might materialize and seek revenge.

### Lore
The Black Diamond is an ancient artifact.
Its true origin is unknown, but in prehistoric times it was uncovered by dwarves under a mountain.
They presented it to the Seelie Court as a gift in good faith.
Titania's sister, the Queen of Air and Darkness, was utterly corrupted by it,
which ultimately lead to the destruction of the original sylvan realm.

It is not known when or why exactly the diamond was split into its facets.
Maybe the queen split them in an attempt to hide the source of her power from her enemies.
Or she tried to reinforce their avatars and cover more ground for her evil plan to enslave all of the sylvan races.
Maybe it got shattered during a conflict with Titania and other members of the Seelie Court.
However it happened though, now the facets spread corruption throughout the planes.

A black diamond facet alone already holds a lot of power,
when two or more come together their evil magic is said to multiply.
All ten of them combined could be enough to destroy an entire plane or at least make it uninhabitable.


## Moonblade
*Martial weapon (longsword), melee weapon, legendary (requires attunement by an elf or half-elf of neutral good alignment)*

Of all the magic items created by the elves, one of the most prized and jealously guarded is a moonblade. In ancient times, nearly all elven noble houses claimed one such blade. Over the centuries, some blades have faded from the world, their magic lost as family lines have become extinct. Other blades have vanished with their bearers during great quests. Thus, only a few of these weapons remain.

A moonblade passes down from parent to child. The sword chooses its bearer and remains bonded to that person for life. If the bearer dies, another heir can claim the blade. If no worthy heir exists, the sword lies dormant. It functions like a normal longsword until a worthy soul finds it and lays claim to its power.

A moonblade serves only one master at a time. The attunement process requires a special ritual in the throne room of an elven regent or in a temple dedicated to the elven gods.

A moonblade won't serve anyone it regards as craven, erratic, corrupt, or at odds with preserving and protecting elvenkind. If the blade rejects you, you make ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws with disadvantage for 24 hours. If the blade accepts you, you become attuned to it and a new rune appears on the blade. You remain attuned to the weapon until you die or the weapon is destroyed.

A moonblade has one rune on its blade for each master it has served (typically 1d6 + 1). The first rune always grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Each rune beyond the first grants the moon blade an additional property. The DM chooses each property or determines it randomly on the Moon Blade Properties table.

**Sentience.** A moonblade is a sentient neutral good weapon with an Intelligence of 12, a Wisdom of 10, and a Charisma of 12. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.
The weapon communicates by transmitting emotions, sending a tingling sensation through the wielder's hand when it wants to communicate something it has sensed. It can communicate more explicitly, through visions or dreams, when the wielder is either in a trance or asleep.

**Personality.** Every moonblade seeks the advancement of elvenkind and elven ideals. Courage, loyalty, beauty, music, and life are all part of this purpose.
The weapon is bonded to the family line it is meant to serve. Once it has bonded with an owner who shares its ideals, its loyalty is absolute.

If a moonblade has a flaw, it is overconfidence. Once it has decided on an owner, it believes that only that person should wield it, even if the owner falls short of elven ideals.

> **Variant: New Moonblade Properties**
> New properties a moonblade might gain with a rune.
>
> - The moonblade gains the **Reach** property.
> - The moonblade functions as a **Sword of Sharpness**.
>
> **Corrupted Properties.**
> - A purple and black shimmer surrounds the blade.
>   The base damage of the blade becomes necrotic damage
>   When you hit with an attack using the moonblade, the attack deals an extra 1d6 necrotic damage.
>   When you hit a fey or a creature with fey ancestry with the moonblade, the target takes an extra 1d6 necrotic damage.
>   When you hit a creature of good alignment with the moonblade, the target takes an extra 1d6 necrotic damage.

## Corrupted Moonblade
*Martial weapon (longsword), melee weapon, legendary (requires attunement by an elf or half-elf of neutral evil alignment)*

A Moonblade is opposed to evil wielders and those who strive towards the destruction of elvenkind.
It will use any option at its disposal to avoid being used by such creatures.
However, its power is limited and there are beings and even items that can overcome its defenses.
Most of the times, a moonblade will just vanish from existence before it surrenders to an evil power.

In the event that the moonblade endures the corruption, the runes from its former masters get damaged (typically 1d4 + 1).
For each damaged rune the blade loses a property and gains a different property.
The DM chooses each new property or determines it randomly on the Moon Blade Properties table.

**Personality.**
The Moonblade is now devoted to the source of its corruption.
Its alignment changes to neutral evil, so does the attunement requirement regarding alignment.
Its personality shifts towards towards the goals of source of corruption.
If the source does not have any specific goals the blades personality inverts.
Instead of seeking the advancement of elvenkind and elven ideals, the blade will seek the destruction of elvenkind and its ideals.

**Purification of the Blade.**
A corrupted moonblade can be purified by an elven ritual similar to the ritual of heritage.
If the moonblade is recovered, a number of runes can be recovered as well (typically 1d4 + 1).
It automatically looses any properties dealing necrotic damage.

     When you hit with an attack using the moonblade, the attack deals an extra die of necrotic damage.
     When you hit a fey or a creature with fey ancestry or good alignment, the target takes an extra die necrotic damage.

## Gem of Brilliance
*Wondrous item (Diamond), major tier, very rare (requires attunement)*
___
This prismatic diamond emits dim bluish light in a 30-foot radius when at least one undead is within that area. Any undead that starts its turn in that area takes 1d6 radiant damage.

This prism has 50 charges. It regains 1d10 + 5 expended charges daily at dawn. While you are holding it, you can use an action to speak one of four command words to cause one of the following effects:

- The first command word causes the gem to shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. This effect doesn't expend a charge. It lasts until you use a bonus action to repeat the command word or until you use another function of the gem.
- The second command word expends 1 charge and causes the gem to fire a brilliant beam of light at one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become blinded for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
- The third command word expends 5 charges and causes the gem to flare with blinding light in a 30-foot cone originating from it. Each creature in the cone must make a saving throw as if struck by the beam created with the second command word.
- The fourth command word expends 15 charges and causes the gem to cast *prismatic spray* (save DC 18).

When all of the gem's charges are expended, the gem becomes a nonmagical jewel worth 50 gp.

> [EGW] Each Vestige of Divergence is a magic item that evolves with its wielder. If not attuned to a worthy individual over a prolonged period, such items commonly revert to their dormant state. While in this state, a Vestige of Divergence grants an attuned bearer only some of its power. Over time, and in response to perseverance and personal growth, a Vestige of Divergence might unlock facets of its lost capabilities to enter an awakened state. Eventually, through extreme personal challenge, evolution, and achievement, these artifacts can reach their ultimate potential in their exalted state. The properties and features gained at each new state are cumulative with the properties and features granted at a previous state, unless otherwise noted.

## Ring of Heroes
*Ring, legendary (requires attunement)*
___
These magic rings were crafted by the Lunar priests of Selûne over a century ago.
They were distributed to the most honorable among the knights of Selûne and Valor Guardians.
It is unknown to most how many were created and most of them were lost during the Siege of Murann.
The rings that remain lie dormant until a worthy heir appears before them, who carries a love for Murann in their heart.

- **Sentience.**
  A *ring of heroes* is a sentient neutral good item with an Intelligence of 12, a Wisdom of 10, and a Charisma of 12.
  It has hearing and normal vision out to a range of 60 feet.
  The ring communicates by transmitting emotions, sending a tingling sensation through the wielder's hand when it wants to communicate something it has sensed.
  It can communicate more explicitly, through visions or dreams, when the wielder is either in a trance or asleep.
- **Personality.**
  Every *ring of heroes* seeks to protect Murann at all costs.
  It is reluctant to leave the city.
  It likes everything moon related and is faithful to Selûne.
  When fighting evil shapechangers, specifically lycanthropes, it enjoys itself.
  Otherwise the personality resembles the one of its previous wielder(s).

> **Previous Wielder.**
> A knight of Selûne.
> a saint of Selûne?

- **Dormant.** A *ring of heroes* grants the following benefits in its dormant state:
  - A *ring of heroes* acts as a *Ring of Spell Storing*.
  - During a long rest you can choose 5 levels worth of spells from the moon spell list to fill the rings slots.
    > TODO: what is the spell casting modifier?

- **Awakened.** Once a *ring of heroes* reaches an awakened state, it gains the following properties:
  - **Perceive True Shape.**
    You can perceives the original form of a shapechanger or a creature that is transformed by magic within 60ft.
    You gain Darkvision out to 60 feet, as long as it is not new moon.
    During a full moon you gain Truesight out to 60 feet.
    If you already have either Darkvision or Truesight, your range increases by 60 feet instead.
  - **Turn Lycanthropes.**
    Once per day as an action, you present the ring and it shines a bright moon light.
    Each lycanthrope that can see within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw.
    If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.

    A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.

> FIXME: additional slots? maybe split slots (2 awakened, 3 exalted) (1 awakened, 1 exalted)

- **Exalted.** Once a *ring of heroes* reaches an exalted state, it gains the following properties:
  - The ring stores an additional five slots worth of spells that can only be used by the moon spell list.
  - **Temporal Salvation.**
    If you die while wearing this ring, you vanish and reappear in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the space you left (or the nearest unoccupied space).
    You have a number of hit points equal to 3d6 + your Constitution modifier.
    If your hit point maximum is lower than the number of hit points you regain, your hit point maximum rises to a similar amount.
    If you have any levels of exhaustion, reduce your level of exhaustion by 1.
    Once this feature is used, it can not be used again until the next full moon.
  - **Moon Chosen.**
    If you wear this ring you ignore the lineage (race) requirement, when attuning to a *Moonblade*.
    (You do not need to be attuned to the ring to benefit from this.
    But the ring needs to be in its exalted state.)

## maneuver

### homebrew

**Move Forward.** [strong][combat][ally]
When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you may expend a superiority die to move your party forward.
As a reaction one of your allies may use the dash action.
You also add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll.

Buff for later:
If the superiority die reads an even number, the movement of the ally does not provoke opportunity attacks.

**Battle Inspiration.** [strong][combat][ally]
When either you or a friendly creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes an attack roll, you can expend a superiority die to roll the die and add half the result to that attack roll. You can do this before or after the attack roll is made, but before you know whether or not it was a hit. If choosing another creature, you must use your reaction to use this maneuver, and the creature must be able to either see or hear you to benefit.

**Blinding Attack.** [middle][combat]
When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to strike a particularly sensitive area or throw something into its eyes. You add your superiority die to the attack’s damage roll, and the creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature is blinded until the end of the current turn.

**Deny Death.** [strong][combat][ally]
When you or a friendly creature adjacent to you makes a death saving throw, you can expend one superiority die to invoke the fighting spirit. Add your superiority die to the saving throw’s result, and if the save succeeds (and was not a 20), the creature automatically stabilizes. You must use your reaction when performing this maneuver on another creature.

**Disrupting Attack.** [strong][combat]
When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to disrupt the creature’s concentration. You add the superiority die to the attack’s damage roll, and the creature has disadvantage on any Constitution saving throw it must make to maintain concentration as a result of the attack.

**Distant Attack.** [strong][combat]
When you make an attack with a ranged or thrown weapon, you can expend a superiority die to double the normal range of the weapon, and increase the maximum range by the same number of feet added, for the remainder of your turn. If your initial attack hits, add your superiority die to the attack’s damage roll.

**Glancing Blow.** [middle][combat]
When you miss with an attack roll and did not roll a 1, you can expend a superiority die to make the attack a glancing blow. The creature takes half the damage your weapon would normally deal on a hit, plus half of your superiority die.

**Grabbing Attack.** [strong][combat]
When you hit with a weapon attack, you can expend a superiority die and add it to the damage of the attack, then you can attempt a grapple against the hit creature as a free action, dropping or sheathing a different held item if necessary to gain a free hand.

**Hurricane Strike.** [middle-strong][combat]
As an action, you can expend a superiority die to make a spinning attack, striking all nearby foes. Each creature within 5 feet of you must make a Strength saving throw. On a failure, a creature is pushed 5 feet away from you and takes bludgeoning damage equal to your superiority die.

**On Guard.** [middle][combat]
When you miss an attack made as an opportunity attack using your reaction, you can expend one superiority die to immediately regain use of your reaction for the round. You cannot use this reaction to respond to the same action which triggered your initial opportunity attack.

**Pinning Attack.** [middle][combat]
When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend a superiority die and add it to the damage of the roll. In addition, that creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the creature is effectively pinned in place, reducing its speed to 0 until the end of your next turn. The creature or another, adjacent creature can use its action to free it from this effect. Creatures with the ability to move through small cracks or objects are immune to this effect.

**Shake It Off.** [strong][combat][ally]
When either you or a friendly creature within 30 feet of you that can see or hear you makes a saving throw to end an effect on themselves, you can expend one superiority die as a reaction. Roll your superiority die and add it to that saving throw.

### Unearthed Arcana

**Ambush.** [strong][skill]
When you make a Dexterity (Stealth) check or an initiative roll, you can expend one superiority die and add the die to the roll.

**Bait and Switch.** [middle][combat][ally]
When you’re within 5 feet of an ally on your turn, you can expend one superiority die and switch places with that ally, provided you spend at least 5 feet of movement. This movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks. Roll the superiority die. Until the start of your next turn, the ally gains a bonus to AC equal to the number rolled.

**Silver Tongue.** [middle][skill]
When you make a Charisma (Deception) check or a Charisma (Persuasion) check, you can expend one superiority die, and add the superiority die to the ability check.

**Studious Eye.** [middle][skill]
When you make a Wisdom (Insight) check or an Intelligence (Investigation) check, you can expend one superiority die, and add the superiority die to the ability check.

### maybe

**Quick Recovery.**
When you catch second wind, you restore one spent superiority die.

**Prepare For Battle.**
When a friendly creature within 30 feet of you is surprised but you are not, you can immediately expend one superiority die to spur the creature into action and allow them to act on their initiative count. However, that creature cannot take bonus actions, make more than a single weapon attack, or cast a spell except a cantrip during that round. A creature must be able to see or hear you to benefit from this maneuver.

**Elemental Infusion.**
When you select this maneuver, select a damage type from the following list: acid, cold, fire, poison, thunder, lightning, and necrotic. When you deal additional damage with a superiority die on one of your attacks when using a maneuver, you can choose for that damage to be of the selected type.

### NOT

old: **Move Forward.**
When you hit a creature with a ranged weapon attack, you may expend a superiority die to dash as a bonus action.
Either towards the target of your attack, or if your attack kills it to a second opponent.
You also add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll.

**Commander’s Eye.**
At the start of your turn during combat, you can expend a superiority die to quickly take in your surroundings. You can make either an Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Perception) check to notice or identify something within your range of vision, and you add your superiority die to the result.

### ideas
