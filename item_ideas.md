## Moonblade
*Martial weapon (longsword), melee weapon, legendary (requires attunement by an elf or half-elf of neutral good alignment)*

Of all the magic items created by the elves, one of the most prized and jealously guarded is a moonblade. In ancient times, nearly all elven noble houses claimed one such blade. Over the centuries, some blades have faded from the world, their magic lost as family lines have become extinct. Other blades have vanished with their bearers during great quests. Thus, only a few of these weapons remain.

A moonblade passes down from parent to child. The sword chooses its bearer and remains bonded to that person for life. If the bearer dies, another heir can claim the blade. If no worthy heir exists, the sword lies dormant. It functions like a normal longsword until a worthy soul finds it and lays claim to its power.

A moonblade serves only one master at a time. The attunement process requires a special ritual in the throne room of an elven regent or in a temple dedicated to the elven gods.

A moonblade won't serve anyone it regards as craven, erratic, corrupt, or at odds with preserving and protecting elvenkind. If the blade rejects you, you make ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws with disadvantage for 24 hours. If the blade accepts you, you become attuned to it and a new rune appears on the blade. You remain attuned to the weapon until you die or the weapon is destroyed.

A moonblade has one rune on its blade for each master it has served (typically 1d6 + 1). The first rune always grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Each rune beyond the first grants the moon blade an additional property. The DM chooses each property or determines it randomly on the Moon Blade Properties table.

**Sentience.** A moonblade is a sentient neutral good weapon with an Intelligence of 12, a Wisdom of 10, and a Charisma of 12. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.
The weapon communicates by transmitting emotions, sending a tingling sensation through the wielder's hand when it wants to communicate something it has sensed. It can communicate more explicitly, through visions or dreams, when the wielder is either in a trance or asleep.

**Personality.** Every moonblade seeks the advancement of elvenkind and elven ideals. Courage, loyalty, beauty, music, and life are all part of this purpose.
The weapon is bonded to the family line it is meant to serve. Once it has bonded with an owner who shares its ideals, its loyalty is absolute.

If a moonblade has a flaw, it is overconfidence. Once it has decided on an owner, it believes that only that person should wield it, even if the owner falls short of elven ideals.

> **Variant: New Moonblade Properties**
> New properties a moonblade might gain with a rune.
>
> - The moonblade gains the **Reach** property.

>   The base damage of the blade becomes necrotic damage
>   When you hit with an attack using the moonblade, the attack deals an extra 1d6 necrotic damage.
>   When you hit a fey or a creature with fey ancestry with the moonblade, the target takes an extra 1d6 necrotic damage.
>   When you hit a creature of good alignment with the moonblade, the target takes an extra 1d6 necrotic damage.

## Corrupted Moonblade
*Martial weapon (longsword), melee weapon, legendary (requires attunement by an elf or half-elf of neutral evil alignment)*

A Moonblade is opposed to evil wielders and those who strive towards the destruction of elvenkind.
It will use any option at its disposal to avoid being used by such creatures.
However, its power is limited and there are beings and even items that can overcome its defenses.
Most of the times, a moonblade will just vanish from existence before it surrenders to an evil power.

In the event that the moonblade endures the corruption, the runes from its former masters get damaged (typically 1d4 + 1).
For each damaged rune the blade loses a property and gains a different property.
The DM chooses each new property or determines it randomly on the Moon Blade Properties table.

**Personality.**
The Moonblade is now devoted to the source of its corruption.
Its alignment changes to neutral evil, so does the attunement requirement regarding alignment.
Its personality shifts towards towards the goals of source of corruption.
If the source does not have any specific goals the blades personality inverts.
Instead of seeking the advancement of elvenkind and elven ideals, the blade will seek the destruction of elvenkind and its ideals.

**Purification of the Blade.**
A corrupted moonblade can be purified by an elven ritual similar to the ritual of heritage.
If the moonblade is recovered, a number of runes can be recovered as well (typically 1d4 + 1).
It automatically looses any properties dealing necrotic damage.

> [EGW] Each Vestige of Divergence is a magic item that evolves with its wielder. If not attuned to a worthy individual over a prolonged period, such items commonly revert to their dormant state. While in this state, a Vestige of Divergence grants an attuned bearer only some of its power. Over time, and in response to perseverance and personal growth, a Vestige of Divergence might unlock facets of its lost capabilities to enter an awakened state. Eventually, through extreme personal challenge, evolution, and achievement, these artifacts can reach their ultimate potential in their exalted state. The properties and features gained at each new state are cumulative with the properties and features granted at a previous state, unless otherwise noted.

## Ring of Heroes
*Ring, legendary (requires attunement)*
___
These magic rings were crafted by the Lunar priests of Selûne over a century ago.
They were distributed to the most honorable among the knights of Selûne and Valor Guardians.
It is unknown to most how many were created and most of them were lost during the Siege of Murann.
The rings that remain lie dormant until a worthy heir appears before them, who carries a love for Murann in their heart.

- **Sentience.**
  A *ring of heroes* is a sentient neutral good item with an Intelligence of 12, a Wisdom of 10, and a Charisma of 12.
  It has hearing and normal vision out to a range of 60 feet.
  The ring communicates by transmitting emotions, sending a tingling sensation through the wielder's hand when it wants to communicate something it has sensed.
  It can communicate more explicitly, through visions or dreams, when the wielder is either in a trance or asleep.
- **Personality.**
  Every *ring of heroes* seeks to protect Murann at all costs.
  It is reluctant to leave the city.
  It likes everything moon related and is faithful to Selûne.
  When fighting evil shapechangers, specifically lycanthropes, it enjoys itself.
  Otherwise the personality resembles the one of its previous wielder(s).

> **Previous Wielder.**
> A knight of Selûne.
> a saint of Selûne?

- **Dormant.** A *ring of heroes* grants the following benefits in its dormant state:
  - A *ring of heroes* acts as a *Ring of Spell Storing*.
  - During a long rest you can choose 5 levels worth of spells from the moon spell list to fill the rings slots.
    The spell save DC for those spells is 13.

- **Awakened.** Once a *ring of heroes* reaches an awakened state, it gains the following properties:
  - The ring stores an additional two slots worth of spells that can only be used by the moon spell list.
  - The save DC of moon spells increases to 15.
  - **Perceive True Shape.**
    You can perceives the original form of a shapechanger or a creature that is transformed by magic within 60ft.
    You gain Darkvision out to 60 feet, as long as it is not new moon.
    During a full moon you gain Truesight out to 60 feet.
    If you already have either Darkvision or Truesight, your range increases by 60 feet instead.
  - **Turn Lycanthropes.**
    Once per day as an action, you present the ring and it shines a bright moon light.
    Each lycanthrope that can see within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw.
    If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.

    A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.

- **Exalted.** Once a *ring of heroes* reaches an exalted state, it gains the following properties:
  - The ring stores an additional three slots worth of spells that can only be used by the moon spell list.
  - The save DC of moon spells increases to 17.
  - **Temporal Salvation.**
    If you die while wearing this ring, you vanish and reappear in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the space you left (or the nearest unoccupied space).
    You have a number of hit points equal to 3d6 + your Constitution modifier.
    If your hit point maximum is lower than the number of hit points you regain, your hit point maximum rises to a similar amount.
    If you have any levels of exhaustion, reduce your level of exhaustion by 1.
    Once this feature is used, it can not be used again until the next full moon.
  - **Moon Chosen.**
    If you wear this ring you ignore the lineage (race) requirement, when attuning to a *Moonblade*.
    (You do not need to be attuned to the ring to benefit from this.
    But the ring needs to be in its exalted state.)

## maneuver

### homebrew

**Move Forward.** [strong][combat][ally]
When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you may expend a superiority die to move your party forward.
As a reaction one of your allies may use the dash action.
You also add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll.

Buff for later:
If the superiority die reads an even number, the movement of the ally does not provoke opportunity attacks.

**Battle Inspiration.** [strong][combat][ally]
When either you or a friendly creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes an attack roll, you can expend a superiority die to roll the die and add half the result to that attack roll. You can do this before or after the attack roll is made, but before you know whether or not it was a hit. If choosing another creature, you must use your reaction to use this maneuver, and the creature must be able to either see or hear you to benefit.

**Blinding Attack.** [middle][combat]
When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to strike a particularly sensitive area or throw something into its eyes. You add your superiority die to the attack’s damage roll, and the creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature is blinded until the end of the current turn.

**Deny Death.** [strong][combat][ally]
When you or a friendly creature adjacent to you makes a death saving throw, you can expend one superiority die to invoke the fighting spirit. Add your superiority die to the saving throw’s result, and if the save succeeds (and was not a 20), the creature automatically stabilizes. You must use your reaction when performing this maneuver on another creature.

**Disrupting Attack.** [strong][combat]
When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to disrupt the creature’s concentration. You add the superiority die to the attack’s damage roll, and the creature has disadvantage on any Constitution saving throw it must make to maintain concentration as a result of the attack.

**Distant Attack.** [strong][combat]
When you make an attack with a ranged or thrown weapon, you can expend a superiority die to double the normal range of the weapon, and increase the maximum range by the same number of feet added, for the remainder of your turn. If your initial attack hits, add your superiority die to the attack’s damage roll.

**Glancing Blow.** [middle][combat]
When you miss with an attack roll and did not roll a 1, you can expend a superiority die to make the attack a glancing blow. The creature takes half the damage your weapon would normally deal on a hit, plus half of your superiority die.

**Grabbing Attack.** [strong][combat]
When you hit with a weapon attack, you can expend a superiority die and add it to the damage of the attack, then you can attempt a grapple against the hit creature as a free action, dropping or sheathing a different held item if necessary to gain a free hand.

**Hurricane Strike.** [middle-strong][combat]
As an action, you can expend a superiority die to make a spinning attack, striking all nearby foes. Each creature within 5 feet of you must make a Strength saving throw. On a failure, a creature is pushed 5 feet away from you and takes bludgeoning damage equal to your superiority die.

**On Guard.** [middle][combat]
When you miss an attack made as an opportunity attack using your reaction, you can expend one superiority die to immediately regain use of your reaction for the round. You cannot use this reaction to respond to the same action which triggered your initial opportunity attack.

**Pinning Attack.** [middle][combat]
When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend a superiority die and add it to the damage of the roll. In addition, that creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the creature is effectively pinned in place, reducing its speed to 0 until the end of your next turn. The creature or another, adjacent creature can use its action to free it from this effect. Creatures with the ability to move through small cracks or objects are immune to this effect.

**Shake It Off.** [strong][combat][ally]
When either you or a friendly creature within 30 feet of you that can see or hear you makes a saving throw to end an effect on themselves, you can expend one superiority die as a reaction. Roll your superiority die and add it to that saving throw.

### Unearthed Arcana

**Ambush.** [strong][skill]
When you make a Dexterity (Stealth) check or an initiative roll, you can expend one superiority die and add the die to the roll.

**Bait and Switch.** [middle][combat][ally]
When you’re within 5 feet of an ally on your turn, you can expend one superiority die and switch places with that ally, provided you spend at least 5 feet of movement. This movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks. Roll the superiority die. Until the start of your next turn, the ally gains a bonus to AC equal to the number rolled.

**Silver Tongue.** [middle][skill]
When you make a Charisma (Deception) check or a Charisma (Persuasion) check, you can expend one superiority die, and add the superiority die to the ability check.

**Studious Eye.** [middle][skill]
When you make a Wisdom (Insight) check or an Intelligence (Investigation) check, you can expend one superiority die, and add the superiority die to the ability check.

### maybe

**Quick Recovery.**
When you catch second wind, you restore one spent superiority die.

**Prepare For Battle.**
When a friendly creature within 30 feet of you is surprised but you are not, you can immediately expend one superiority die to spur the creature into action and allow them to act on their initiative count. However, that creature cannot take bonus actions, make more than a single weapon attack, or cast a spell except a cantrip during that round. A creature must be able to see or hear you to benefit from this maneuver.

**Elemental Infusion.**
When you select this maneuver, select a damage type from the following list: acid, cold, fire, poison, thunder, lightning, and necrotic. When you deal additional damage with a superiority die on one of your attacks when using a maneuver, you can choose for that damage to be of the selected type.

### NOT

old: **Move Forward.**
When you hit a creature with a ranged weapon attack, you may expend a superiority die to dash as a bonus action.
Either towards the target of your attack, or if your attack kills it to a second opponent.
You also add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll.

**Commander’s Eye.**
At the start of your turn during combat, you can expend a superiority die to quickly take in your surroundings. You can make either an Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Perception) check to notice or identify something within your range of vision, and you add your superiority die to the result.
