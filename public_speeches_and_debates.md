# public speeches and debates
Both the public speeches and debates are social encounters for the favor of an audience. However, while **public speech** can be resolved as a *skill challenge*,
a **public debate** is a **skill contest** between at least two parties.
Each skill check is a contest between the players and their opponent.
A skill contest is not limited by maximum amount of accumulated failures like a skill challenge is.
A debate is finished, when a party does not have any arguments and responses left.
Then the accumulated successes of the players and the opponent are compared.
The side with more successes wins the debate.
While these rules focus on the most likely scenario, one or more player characters against an opponent, usually the villain.
However you can easily use them in a player versus player situation.

A character may participate in a public speech or debate by taking part in the conversation.
If a second character *helps* the main speaker, give the main speaker advantage (see "Help Action").
If they are being unhelpful, they may oppose disadvantage instead.
If more than two characters participate, they perform a group check to determine the success instead.

Depending on how they participate they make a Charisma (Deception, Intimidation or Persuasion) check.
Charisma (Deception) checks are made against the (passive) Wisdom (Insight) of the audience.
Intimidation and Persuasion need to beat a static DC based on the audiences attitude towards the character.
DC 0 for friendly, DC 10 for indifferent and DC 20 for hostile creatures.

After five checks evaluate the attitude of the audience.
For a larger groups in the audience, e.g. commoners or nobles, use the DC listed above.
If the check fails the DC by 10 or more consider it a failure for the attitude change.
If the successes overweight the failures the attitude changes towards the speaker.
For single NPCs with personality traits, you may decide their attitude change based on their personality.
If the speech or the debate finishes before 5 checks are made, evaluate the attitude then.

- skill challenge
  - using Charisma based checks
    - Deception vs. (passive) Insight
    - Persuasion and Intimidation vs. static DC
      - add 10 for friendly creatures
      - subtract 10 for hostile creatures
      - <0 opposes the party
      - 0 remains neutral
      - 10 helps if not risky
      - 20 helps with small risk
      - 30 helps with risk
  - !!! both sides must be able to participate in the contest
    - if one party is not able to communicate to the audience
      - use the normal checks to shift the audiences attitude
      - if just for a time period
        - combine the two rule sets
- checks by number of active players
  - [1] just a regular check
  - [2] one player makes a check with advantage (or disadvantage)
  - [3+] group check
