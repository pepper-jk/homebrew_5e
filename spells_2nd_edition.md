- **Moon Blade** (Alteration, Evocation)
  Spell Level: 3rd Level
  Sphere: Combat, Sun
  Range: 0
  Components: V, S
  Duration: 1 round/level
  Casting Time: 6
  Area of Effect: One swordlike magical construct
  Saving Throw: None

  This spell brings into being a silent, weightless swordlike construct made of moonlight that extends 4 feet straight out from the caster's hand. It cannot be dropped, transferred to the grasp of another being, or broken. To strike, it must be wielded as a weapon. The caster's normal THACO applies, but a moon blade is considered a +4 magical weapon for the purpose of what kinds of beings it is able to hit. Its strike drains vitality or life force, causing no visible wounds, but inflicting ldl2+4 points of damage. Undead are visibly wounded by a moon blade; their substance boils away from its touch, and they suffer 2d 12+4 points of damage per blow.
  A successful moon blade strike temporarily scrambles magic. On the round after being hit, victims cannot cast spells or call on any spell-like abilities. The functioning of existing spell conditions is suspended for that round, and magical items wielded by the victim do not function for that round.
  A moon blade vanishes if its caster is slain or casts any other spell except those that have only verbal components.
  This spell as no connection with the enchanted items known as moonblades borne and made by some elves.

- **Moon Path** (Alteration, Evocation)
  Spell Level: 5th Level
  Sphere: Sun, Travelers
  Range: 5 yards/level
  Components: V, S, M
  Duration: Special
  Casting Time: 8
  Area of Effect: A variable-width, glowing white stair or bridge of translucent force a maximum of 15 feet/level long
  Saving Throw: None

  This spell enables its caster to create a stair or bridge from one known, visualized spot to another. The effect is a railless ribbon of glowing white translucent force like a glass strip that is from 3 to 20 feet wide as the caster decides (and able to vary in width over its length if the caster desires). It is a maximum of 15 feet per level of the caster long, though the caster may make it shorter if space is constricted. It can climb or descend and sticks to its endpoints unshakably, even if these endpoints are actually empty air above known ground features.
  Beings walking on a moon path are protected as follows: They cannot be drained of abilities or experience levels (life force), they cannot be harmed by normal missiles, they are immune to all enchantment/charm spells (although they can sense enough of a spell effect to identify it for what it does), and they cannot fall over or off the moon path, no matter what force strikes it or them.
  A moon path needs no supports, cannot be shattered or moved by any known force, and is stable enough to cast spells from. It vanishes if struck by a successful dispel magic, if the caster wills it to, or if it has been completely traversed by as many beings as the caster has experience levels. Otherwise, it persists for 1 turn/level of the caster. Beings on a moon path that expires or vanishes are subject to normal falling damage when they strike whatever hard surface is below. A magical barrier of the 6th or greater spell level stops a forming moon path or truncates an existing one where the two meet, but the caster cannot choose to banish only a part of his or her moon path in a similar manner. Loss of one part of a moon path has no effect on remaining parts, even if the loss cuts the path in two.
  The material component of this spell is a handful of powdered moonstone.
