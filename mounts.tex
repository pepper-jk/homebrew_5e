\chapter{Nelly's favored Mounts}

The following mounts are designed to be used by the mounted combat rules introduces in the article "Jumping on Mounted Combat" by Willy Abeel in the first issue of \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oid4QMMXjfs}{Arcadia} produced by MCDM.

For now I focused on some basic mounts. However, I plan to work on some more mounts in the future, wyvern mounts, fey (touched) mounts and more beast based mounts for my druid player to turn into.

\section{Basic Mounts}

If adventurers travel long distances they usually rely on mounts to cover more ground per day.
The most common mount would be the \textbf{riding horse}.
However, some folk may require smaller mounts, like \textbf{ponies} or \textbf{mastiffs}, to get around.
Spellcasters may cast \textit{find steed} to get their first mount.
This section covers the most common mounts an adventuring party may start out with.

\begin{DndComment}{Find Steed Variant}
    The spirit summoned by the find steed spell can take the form of a \textbf{mount} over the standard beast, allowing the caster to utilize the new features of the following creatures. This includes the camel, elk, mastiff, pony and warhorse mounts.

    \DndMonsterAction{Mounted}
    During a long rest, the camel can designate one creature that rode it within the last 10 days as its rider. The camel gains \textbf{temporary hit points} equal to 4 times the rider’s character level or challenge rating after completing the long rest. The camel uses its rider’s proficiency bonus in place of its own proficiency bonus for AC, ability checks, attack rolls, saving throws, and the DC made to save against certain action effects.

    ]

    \DndMonsterAction{Herd Trample (3/Day)}
    If the camel moves 15 ft. towards an enemy and at least one other camel joins it, they overrun enemies in their path. While they move together they gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks when it moves out of an enemy’s reach, and can move through spaces occupied by other creatures. Each creature in the herds way must make a DC 11 + PB Strength saving throw or take 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage, plus 5 (1d8) for each additional camel above two, and be knocked prone. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn’t knocked prone.

    \DndMonsterSection{Reactions}

    \DndMonsterAction{Join the Herd}
    If another Camel starts the \textbf{Herd Trample} action, a rider may use their reaction to join the herd. First the camel needs to move up to the other camel and can move with the herd as far as its movement allows. Any movement used in this reaction is subtracted from the movement for the camels next turn.

    If the elk moves at least 15 feet straight toward a target it starts charging.

    \DndMonsterAction{Mounted}
    During a long rest, the elk can designate one creature that rode it within the last 10 days as its rider. The elk gains \textbf{temporary hit points} equal to 4 times the rider’s character level or challenge rating after completing the long rest.

    \DndMonsterAction{Wild Charge (3/Day)}
    The elk gains resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks when it moves out of an enemy’s reach, and can move through spaces occupied by other creatures until the end of its turn. Each creature in the elk’s way must make a DC 11 + PB Strength saving throw or take 13 (3d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn’t knocked prone.

    \DndMonsterSection{Reactions}

    \DndMonsterAction{Antler Parry}
    If either the elk or its rider would be hit by a melee attack, the rider may use their reaction to command the elk to use his antlers to fend off the foe. The elk may either oppose disadvantage against the melee attack or add 2 to its AC and the AC of its rider against all melee attacks from the foe.

    ]

    \DndMonsterAction{Sniff}
    The mastiff sniffs out targets it can not see. It makes a Wisdom (Perception) check with advantage due to its \textit{Keen Hearing and Smell}. If the target is within 30ft. of the mastiff during the mastiffs turn, the target does not benefit from being hidden or invisible against the mastiff and its rider until the start of its next turn.

    \DndMonsterAction{Rear Up (1/Day)}
    Using half its movement the pony rears up, whirling its hooves and inflicting disadvantage on any melee attack rolls within 5ft. of it until the beginning of its next turn. If the pony uses its opportunity attack of the \textbf{Step Out} reaction, this effect ends.

    \DndMonsterSection{Reactions}

    \DndMonsterAction{Step Out}
    If the pony is approached by an opponent from the rear, meaning a creature enters a space behind it, the rider may use their reaction and let the pony perform a \textbf{Combat Stomp} as an attack of opportunity.
