warfare first
then combat

(still happen at the same time

mark down
who wins
on which turn

in combat
on that turn the winner recieves a moral boost
they can use whenever they choose starting at that turn

moral surge
sudden rush of ad

as a bonus action, move half your movement and take an extra action

if you don't use your moral surge until the next long rest, you lose it.

what if the warfare lasts longer than the combat?
- opportunity to convert enemy units?
